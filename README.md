# Ionic timer

Ionic timer is a simple yet useful plugin that allows you to create timers in your ionic apps.

  - Works with all the platforms that ionic supports
  - Simple code
  - Easy to include in your existing app
  - Compatible with your existing code.
 
#### Details
This component has no directives. It uses a simple `$timeout` function for the timer and it has 4 easy functions that allow you to control it:
  - `startTimer`
  - `pauseTimer`
  - `stopTimer`
  - `timer-stopped` (triggered, when the timer stops)

This component has well structured html, css and js files and is commented. It is easy to understand, edit and customize.

All the timers open in a modal for the demo, you can easily use them outside the modal with the same code provided inside it.

#### How does it work?
This component uses both **Moment** and **angular-svg-round-progressbar**. Take a look into this projects to know more about it.
  - [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)
  - [angular-svg-round-progressbar](https://github.com/crisbeto/angular-svg-round-progressbar)

This project already has all the moment files and angular-svg-round-progress files nedded to work. Plus its dependencies. Please check [angular-svg-round-progressbar](http://crisbeto.github.io/angular-svg-round-progressbar/) to know more about customization of the progress bar.
